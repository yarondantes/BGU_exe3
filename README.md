### BGU_exe3
this repo is contain code notebooks for exercise  3 in computational learning 
links to github files:

Q1:
https://github.com/yarondantes/BGU_exe3/blob/main/exe3%20-%20ann_from_scartch.ipynb

the notebook "exe3 - ann_from_scartch.ipynb" contains the code for:

* single layer nn, based on numpy, with additional training functions
* two-layers nn , based on numpy, with additional training functions (with changes from   the first ones)
* two-layers nn, based on pytorch, with additional training functions the results are displayed in the notebook but, described and displays in the final report


Q2:
this assignment contains 4 file:

* pre-process.ipynb - pre-process notebook which contain the pre-process part (Data download, order the data for load as dataset, split to train/test and augment)
https://github.com/yarondantes/BGU_exe3/blob/main/pre-process.ipynb

* yolov5 - notebook contain a model based in transfer learning based on yolov5 for classifying the flowers dataset. the training was done via the yolov5 classification repo (documented in the summery pdf), with minor changes to the code. mainly for documenting the  train test accuracy and loss, during the epochs
https://github.com/yarondantes/BGU_exe3/blob/main/yolov5.ipynb

* vgg19 - notebook contain a model based in transfer learning from vgg19 for classifying the flowers dataset
https://github.com/yarondantes/BGU_exe3/blob/main/vgg19.ipynb

* inceptionv3 - notebook contain a model based in transfer learning based on inceptionv3 for classifying the flowers dataset.
https://github.com/yarondantes/BGU_exe3/blob/main/inceptionv3.ipynb


additional files:

* my_utils.py - a file containing the different pre-process functions (for the models notebooks)
https://github.com/yarondantes/BGU_exe3/blob/main/my_utils.py

* yolo5_results.csv - contain the documented results form the yolov5 training (based on yolo5s-cls)
https://github.com/yarondantes/BGU_exe3/blob/main/yolo5_results.csv

* best.pt - yolov5 final weights (for yolo5s-cls architecture)
https://github.com/yarondantes/BGU_exe3/blob/main/best.pt
