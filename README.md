### BGU_exe3
this repo is for code notebooks for exercise  3 in computational learning 

q1 - 
the notebook "exe3 - ann_from_scartch.ipynb" contains the code for:
* single layer nn, based on numpy, with additional  training functions
* two-layers nn , based on numpy, with additional training functions (with changes from the first ones)
* two-layers nn, based on pytorch, with additional training functions
the results are displayed in the notebook but, described and displays in the final report

 q2 - 
 this assignment contains 4 notebooks:
 * the first one is pre-process which contain the pre-process part (Data download, order the data for load as dataset, split to train/test and augment
 * vgg19 - notebook contain a model based in transfer learning from vgg19 for classifying the flowers dataset
 * yolov5 - notebook contain a model based in transfer learning based on yolov5 for classifying the flowers dataset.
   the training was done via the yolov5 classification repo, with minor changes to the code. mainly for documenting the test accuracy during the epochs
 * inceptionv3 - notebook contain a model based in transfer learning based on inceptionv3 for classifying the flowers dataset.
* my_utils.py - a file containing the different pre-process functions
