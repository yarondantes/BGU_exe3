### BGU_exe3
this repo is for code notebooks for execrsice 3 in computetional learning 

q1 - 
the notebook "exe3 - ann_from_scartch.ipynb" contains the code for:
* single layer nn, based on numpy, with addiotional training functions
* two-layers nn , based on numpy, with additional training functions (with changes from the first ones)
* two-layers nn, based on pytorch, with additionl training functions
the results are displayed in the notebook but, described and displays in the final report

 q2 - 
 this assiments contains 4 notebooks:
 * the first one is pre-process which contain the pre-process part (Data download, order the data for load as dataset, split to train/test and augment
 * vgg19 - notebook contain a model based in transfer learning from vgg19 for classifing the flowers dataset
 * yolov5 - notebook contain a model based in transfer learning based on yolov5 for classifing the flowers dataset.
   the training was done via the yolov5 classification repo, with minor changes to the code. mainly for documenting the test accuracy during the epochs
* inceptionv3 - notebook contain a model based in transfer learning based on inceptionv3 for classifing the flowers dataset.
